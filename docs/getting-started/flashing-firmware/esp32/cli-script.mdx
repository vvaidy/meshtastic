:::caution
Make sure not to power the radio on without first attaching the antenna! You could damage the radio chip!
:::

Before you flash your device start by verifying connectivity with the device being flashed. Outlined below are steps that can be taken to verify connectivity and, if necessary, to install the appropriate drivers. If you end up needing to install drivers be sure to reboot your computer afterwards to verify the installation is complete.

:::note
The [T-Beam 0.7](/docs/hardware/devices/tbeam#t-beam---v07) board is an earlier version of the T-Beam board, and due to changes in the design in subsequent iterations this board uses a specific firmware file different from the other T-Beam boards.

`firmware-tbeam0.7-X.X.X.xxxxxxx.bin` is the correct firmware. `firmware-tbeam-X.X.X.xxxxxxx.bin` is incompatible. For all other [T-Beam](/docs/hardware/devices/tbeam) boards `firmware-tbeam-X.X.X.xxxxxxx.bin` is the correct selection.

Check if you have `python3` and `pip` installed with the following command

```shell
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If `python3` is not installed, install with

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```

If `pip` is not installed, install with

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos">



OS X comes with `Python 2.7` installed, but not `pip`. The following uses Homebrew to install `python3` which includes `pip3`. On MacOS you will use `pip3` instead > of `pip`.

:::note
Check if you have Homebrew installed with the following command

```shell
brew -v
```

If it's not installed, follow the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) before continuing.

Check if you have `python3` and `pip` installed with the following command

```shell
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

If `python3` is not installed, install with
Install Python3

```shell
brew install python3
```

Confirm `pip3` was installed alongside `python3`

```shell
pip3 -v
```

- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org). When installing, make sure to click `Add Python X.Y to PATH`.
- Download and install [Gitbash](https://gitforwindows.org) (or other appropriate shell) and run all subsequent commands from that shell.

:::note
Confirm installation of `python` & `pip` with the following commands.

```shell
py --version
```

```shell
pip --version
```

Connect the radio to your computer using a data USB cable. Confirm your device is talking to your computer using the following command _(Note: on some platforms you might need to use the command `esptool.py` instead of `esptool`)_:

```shell title="Command"
esptool chip_id
```

```shell title="Expected Output"
# You should see a result similar to this:

### Navigate to Firmware

`cd` into the directory where you unzipped the latest release. For example:

```shell title="Example"
cd ~/Downloads/firmware/
```

### Install/Update Firmware

Install or Update the device that you have by using the following commands according to your operating system:

:::caution
Be very careful to install the correct firmware file for your board. In particular, the popular 'T-BEAM' radio from TTGO is not called 'TTGO-Lora' (that is a different board). So don't install the 'TTGO-Lora' build on a TBEAM, it won't work correctly. If you flash the incorrect device firmware, it may appear to successfully complete, yet the device will usually become unresponsive, displaying a blank screen (if equipped). Attempt to flash the correct version. Please note, while these devices are quite resilient and damage is not always likely, there is a possibility of onboard radio and peripheral damage due to incorrect GPIO pin direction.
